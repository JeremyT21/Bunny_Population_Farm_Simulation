# Bunny_Population_Farm_Simulation
I was tasked with simulating the population of bunnies on a farm in C++ using objects, and created a program on my own to be used as a simulation.

To program the simulation, I created a Bunny class to initialize bunnies from,
and stored the bunnies in a Farm object (the Farm class was seperately designed).
